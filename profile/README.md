At WhatStack, like most tech companies, we depend on open source software from all over the world to help us get things done.

We're grateful to the open source community, the projects, and especially their maintainers who have allowed us to innovate and make our customers working lives a little bit more enjoyable.

Listed within this GitHub org, you'll find a collection of things built by WhatStack, which we think folks may find helpful or inspiring.

In addition to publishing open source projects, WhatStack strives to actively participate in improving upon the core frameworks WhatStack is built upon, such as [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) or [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
