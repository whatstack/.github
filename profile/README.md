# 👋 Welcome to WhatStack

At WhatStack, like most tech companies, we depend on open source software from all over the world to help us get things done.

🙏 We're grateful to the open source community, the projects, and especially their maintainers who have allowed us to innovate and make our customers working lives a little bit more enjoyable.

Listed within this GitHub org, you'll find a collection of things built by WhatStack, which we think folks may find helpful or inspiring.

***N.B: All these projects are governed by our [Open source code of conduct](https://docs.whatstack.io/open-source/code-of-conduct).***

In addition to publishing open source projects, WhatStack strives to actively participate in improving upon the core frameworks WhatStack is built upon, such as [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) or [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
